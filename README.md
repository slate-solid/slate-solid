# SlateSolid

![SlateJS](src/assets/slate48.png) ➕ ![SolidJS](src/assets/solid48.png)

A _completely_ customizable framework
for building rich text editors using [SlateJS](https://docs.slatejs.org/) and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/).

> 🤖 **Slate is currently in beta.** See [SolidJS Github Repo](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate).

> 🏗️ **SlateSolid is pre-release**. SlateSolid is modeled largely after `slate-react` but is still in active development to get to feature parity.
